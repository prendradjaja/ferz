# Goal:

This tool:

- get all recent games that are:
  - chess games
- bucketed into time controls
- bucketed into color
- labeled with:
  - rated
  - against human opponents
- and with properties:
  - move list
  - game id

That is, it will return a list of games, with the following properties:

- rated
- human_opponent
- recent
- move_list
- game_id

To be used in a future tool, that will:

- filter by:
  - recency
  - whether or not the game was rated
  - whether or not the opponent was human
- given a game-prefix, show:
  - number of games
  - responses (with percentages and counts)
  - link to games

That tool could be graphical or terminal-based. If terminal-based:

  (algebraic move) = go down
  .                = go up one
  ...              = go up three
  1                = go to root
  h                = toggle human
  r                = toggle rated
  3d               = recency filter at 3 days
  7m
  2y
  g                = show games (paginated)
  n                = next page of games
  4n

# To do:

- [ ] Determine if pagination breaks if new games are played. Any possible consequences?
